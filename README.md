# bfm-fast-diffusion

## Description

Codes for solving the following problem:
$$
\rho^{n+1} = \text{arg}\min_{\rho} \int \rho \log \rho dx + V(\rho) + \frac{1}{2\tau} W^2_2(\rho, \rho^n)
$$
using the back-and-forth method (BFM).

Details of the algorithm can be found in this paper: [The back-and-forth method for Wasserstein gradient flows,
Matt Jacobs, Wonjun Lee, and Flavien LÃ©ger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08151.pdf).
